# Homework 2: Visualizing Data Sets

The Project [Link](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2020fall/hw_02)

## My First Graph
![Rick and Morty](https://github.com/valerialoria/homework2/blob/main/Graph%201.png)

In this graph I chose to compare the season 1 and season 2 of Rick and Morty and the amount of epsiodes in each season. As you can see, the first season had one more episode than the second one. I found the data set [here](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets).

## My Second Graph
![Cereals](https://github.com/valerialoria/homework2/blob/main/Graph%202.png) 

In this graph I compared the amount of sugar and fiber in each of the 4 cereals. The blue line represents the amount of sugar and the red line represents the amount of fiber. As you can see this varies per cereal brand and they all differ. I found the data set to this graph [here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets).
